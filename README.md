# Selenium Project

This repository contains Python scripts related to Selenium automation. The files demonstrate various concepts and functionalities, including:


- **Selenium locators**: `locators_task_01.py`


## Files Overview:

*   `locators_task_01.py`: Specifically deals with XPath locators in Selenium.

## Getting Started:

To run these scripts, you will need:

1.  Python installed on your system.
2.  Selenium WebDriver library (`pip install selenium`).
3.  A compatible web browser driver (e.g., ChromeDriver, GeckoDriver) configured in your system's PATH or specified in your scripts.

## Usage:

Each Python file can be run individually to observe its specific functionality. For Selenium-related scripts, ensure your browser driver is correctly set up.

```bash
python your_script_name.py
